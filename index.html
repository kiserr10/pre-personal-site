What’s going on everyone! My name is Ross and I couldn’t be any more excited to be spending the next six months with all of you.  I am originally from Boston, MA and I moved out here in 2008 to attend the University of Colorado at Boulder.  After graduating I moved down to Denver and don’t see myself leaving any time soon.  I absolutely love it here.  My parents still live in Boston, and my little sister goes to school in Vermont.
Over the last four and a half years I have been working at a restaurant downtown while pursuing a passion for music.  I produce and perform underground dance music and co-founded a record label with some friends a few years ago.  Other passions of mine include climbing, cooking and design.
