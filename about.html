As I mentioned earlier, I couldn’t be more excited to be taking this course and to be starting this next chapter of my life.  I feel that development will be the perfect outlet to express my creativity.  Programming is the core of all technology and I love the idea that you can create something from absolutely nothing.  I have known about Galvanize for quite some time and have had a few friends go through the program as well.  Earlier this year I took the Immersive Prep Workshop through Galvanize and got a taste of what programming and web development is all about.  I was shocked and excited to say the least.  I figured the time was right and well, here I am.  I’m very excited to be joining the family and to start learning some serious code! After graduating I hope to use the new skills to explore new options and creative avenues.  I would love to work for a company that is making or doing something new and out of the ordinary. I hope I will have the tools and a new set of competencies to become a better problem solver and creator of opportunity. The possibilities are truly endless.
